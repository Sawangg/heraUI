# HeraUI

This is UI library (currently in alpha) created on top of react-aria-components and TailwindCSS.

## Usage

Install the dependencies and just clone or copy the `ui` folder into your project. Start importing the components, it has never been that easy!

#### Dark mode

You need to add this property in your tailwind config if you wish to control the dark mode

```js
darkMode: "class",
```

## Dependencies

Here is a list of dependencies needed (currently only supporting TypeScript).

```
npm i react-aria-components tailwindcss clsx
```
```
yarn add react-aria-components tailwindcss clsx
```
```
pnpm add react-aria-components tailwindcss clsx
```
```
bun i react-aria-components tailwindcss clsx
```
